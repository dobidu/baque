# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .paul/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-04)

**Core value:** Producers build beats with authentic micro-timing feel — off-grid groove, lo-fi color, and controlled error as first-class features
**Current focus:** Project initialized — ready for planning

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.0 Release
Phase: 1 of 13 (Setup) — Planning
Plan: 01-01 loop closed; 01-02 next
Status: Ready for next PLAN
Last activity: 2026-06-04 — 01-01 UNIFY complete; SUMMARY created

Progress:
- Milestone: [█░░░░░░░░░] 4%
- Phase 1: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Loop Position

Current loop state:
```
PLAN ──▶ APPLY ──▶ UNIFY
  ✓        ✓        ✓     [Loop complete — ready for 01-02 APPLY]
```

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

| Decision | Phase | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Feel Engine is product core | Init | Phase 5 is the keystone; everything orbits it |
| SoundTouch fork in separate repo (LGPL) | Init | R&D-TS parallel track from Phase 4; fork v1 blocks Phase 4 |
| v1 formats: VST3 + AU + Standalone | Init | CLAP/AAX/LV2 deferred |
| Enterprise plan audit enabled | Init | Architectural review between PLAN and APPLY (RT-safety focus) |
| Linux full v1 target (resolves §14.9) | Phase 1 | 3-OS CI matrix from start; Linux VST3 + Standalone in release |
| 2026-06-04: Enterprise audit on 01-01 (3 must-have + 3 strong applied, 2 deferred) and 01-02 (5 strong applied, 2 deferred). Verdict both: conditionally acceptable → upgraded | Phase 1 | Plugin identity locked (br.ufpb.lavid.baque, 'Lvd0'/'Bqe1'); JUCE tag pinned; AU + lipo gates in CI |

### Deferred Issues

| Issue | Origin | Effort | Revisit |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| Sample embed in presets (opt-in "collect & save"?) | ESCOPO §14.5 | M | Phase 11 (presets) |
| Song mode depth — chaining only in v1? | ESCOPO §14.6 | M | Phase 3 planning |
| Multi-out in v1 vs v1.1 | ESCOPO §14.7 | M | Phase 9/10 planning |

### Blockers/Concerns
None yet.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-06-04
Stopped at: Audit complete on both Phase 1 plans; user paused before APPLY
Next action: /paul:apply .paul/phases/01-setup/01-02-PLAN.md
Resume file: .paul/phases/01-setup/01-01-SUMMARY.md
Resume context:
- 01-01 loop fully closed; skeleton builds, pluginval passes, git clean
- 01-02: Catch2 + 3-OS CI (GitHub Actions) — contains human checkpoint (create repo, push, confirm "ci green")
- auval (AU validation) + lipo (universal gate) required by audit; xvfb-run for Linux tests
