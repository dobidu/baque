# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .paul/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-04)

**Core value:** Producers build beats with authentic micro-timing feel — off-grid groove, lo-fi color, and controlled error as first-class features
**Current focus:** Phase 3 (Sequencer Base) complete — step grid, swing, pattern switch, NoteTracker; starting Phase 4 (Sample Engine)

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.0 Release
Phase: 4 of 13 (Sample Engine) — Not started
Plan: Phase 3 complete — transitioning to Phase 4
Status: Ready to plan Phase 4
Last activity: 2026-06-05 — Phase 3 (Sequencer Base) complete, all 2 plans unified

Progress:
- Milestone: [███░░░░░░░] 23%
- Phase 3: [██████████] 100% ✅

## Loop Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

| Decision | Phase | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Feel Engine is product core | Init | Phase 5 is the keystone; everything orbits it |
| SoundTouch fork in separate repo (LGPL) | Init | R&D-TS parallel track from Phase 4; fork v1 blocks Phase 4 |
| v1 formats: VST3 + AU + Standalone | Init | CLAP/AAX/LV2 deferred |
| Enterprise plan audit enabled | Init | Architectural review between PLAN and APPLY (RT-safety focus) |
| Linux full v1 target (resolves §14.9) | Phase 1 | 3-OS CI matrix from start; Linux VST3 + Standalone in release |
| 2026-06-04: Enterprise audit on 01-01 (3 must-have + 3 strong applied, 2 deferred) and 01-02 (5 strong applied, 2 deferred). Verdict both: conditionally acceptable → upgraded | Phase 1 | Plugin identity locked (br.ufpb.lavid.baque, 'Lvd0'/'Bqe1'); JUCE tag pinned; AU + lipo gates in CI |
| Catch2 test names must be ASCII-only | Phase 1 | Windows ctest PRE_TEST filter mangles UTF-8; affects all future tests |
| Node.js 20 action deprecation deferred | Phase 1 | actions/checkout@v5 + cache@v5 upgrade; deadline June 16, 2026 |
| 2026-06-04: Enterprise audit on 02-01 (4 must-have + 2 strong applied, 1 deferred) and 02-02 (2 must-have + 3 strong applied, 2 deferred). Verdict both: conditionally acceptable → upgraded | Phase 2 | WAV header parsing via JUCE decoder; start_offset_ in 02-01 not 02-02; getPlayHead null-guard; steal never null |
| Note-off per-note tracking deferred to Phase 3 | Phase 2 Scheduler note-off is no-op; Phase 3 needs note→voice map for correct stuck-note prevention | Phase 2 | Phase 3 must add MIDI note tracking |
| MIDI channel ignored in Phase 2 | All channels trigger; Phase 3 needs channel routing for INT/EXT hybrid mode | Phase 2 | Phase 3 scope item |
| 2026-06-05: Enterprise audit on 03-01 (3 must-have + 2 strong applied, 2 deferred) and 03-02 (4 must-have + 1 strong applied, 2 deferred). Verdict both: conditionally acceptable → upgraded | Phase 3 | MidiBuffer two-call approach, generate() algorithm, double-trigger guard, atomic pattern switch, memory_order for swing |
| NoteTracker fallback to pattern note on first block | Tracker=0 at startup; note-off would be skipped without fallback | All consumers of NoteTracker must handle first-block case |
| MIDI channel routing still global in Phase 3 | All channels trigger; deferred to Phase 9 | Phase 9 must add per-lane channel filter |

### Deferred Issues

| Issue | Origin | Effort | Revisit |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| Sample embed in presets (opt-in "collect & save"?) | ESCOPO §14.5 | M | Phase 11 (presets) |
| Song mode depth — chaining only in v1? | ESCOPO §14.6 | M | Phase 3 planning |
| Multi-out in v1 vs v1.1 | ESCOPO §14.7 | M | Phase 9/10 planning |
| Upgrade CI actions/checkout + cache from v4→v5 (Node.js 20 deprecated) | Phase 1 | S | Before June 16, 2026 (deadline from GitHub) |

### Blockers/Concerns
None yet.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-06-05
Stopped at: Phase 3 transition complete; paused before Phase 4 planning
Next action: /paul:plan (Phase 4 — Sample Engine: slice/chop, pitch, choke, velocity layers, reverse)
Resume file: .paul/HANDOFF-2026-06-05.md
Resume context:
- Phase 3 fully closed; 21/21 tests; pluginval green; commit fdf1571 on main
- Phase 4 BLOCKS on R&D-TS SoundTouch fork v1 — flag during planning
- CI Node.js 20 action upgrade due before June 16, 2026
